Potato and Corn Chowder - Makes 6-8 servings

Ingredients:
- Bacon as desired (see bacon instructions)
- 1-2 Tbsp cooking oil
- 1 sliced or chopped white or yellow onion
- 3-4 lbs roughly chopped yukon gold potatoes
- 2 boxes (64 oz) chicken broth
- 1 lb grated cheddar cheese
- 1-2 Tbsp flour
- Whipping cream
- 12-16 oz frozen corn
- Salt and Pepper to taste

3 ways to include bacon:
1. Cook bacon in an oven at 400 for 15-17 minutes while the soup is cooking, then crumble slices into the pot before the cheese
   (Favorite method)
2. Add prepackaged or oven-baked bacon pieces to each bowl before eating
3. Cut up 8 oz to 1 lb of bacon and cook it for a couple minutes in the pot before adding the onion. It will continue to cook
   and crisp up until the broth is added and will usually soften while submerged in the soup. (This is my least favorite method)

Method:
- Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven over medium heat
- Add the onion and cook until just starting to brown
- Add potatoes and cook, stiring occasionally, until the outer portion of the potatoes start to turn translucent
- Add chicken broth and bring to a boil
- Reduce heat to med-low and cover, let cook for 20 min
- Shake grated cheese and flour in a bag
- Add cream to soup until it's the desired off-white color
- Add cheese to soup and stir until it's all melted
- Add salt and pepper to taste
- Let the soup come to a boil again then stir in frozen corn, cook a minute or two

Serve hot

Tips:
- The first method for including bacon gets the most bacon flavor into the chowder but is very hard to time properly to avoid
  burnt or soggy bacon.
- If the potatoes are too bland, try adding salt and pepper while they're cooking then adjust the flavor in the broth after the
  cheese is added.
- Shaking the cheese and flour together helps insulate the cheese when adding it to the soup so it's able to heat slowly and 
  melt rather than turn into a stringy mess
- I use whipping cream, but half and half works if you don't mind using about twice as much for a less rich flavor.
- This always tastes better the 2nd day
